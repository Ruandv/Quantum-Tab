# This is a placeholder for the extension icons
# Replace these with actual PNG icon files:
# - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
# - icon32.png (32x32 pixels)  
# - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
# - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

# You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator.
# Make sure they represent your extension's branding and purpose.

# For now, you can use any PNG images with the correct dimensions
# and rename them accordingly.
